                My name is Ferenc Bacs√≥, and I have been working as a frontend developer since 2019.
                <p>I am thrilled to share my work and passion for web development with you.
                  In 2022, I was recognized for my outstanding contributions in the field, an achievement that I am truly proud of.</p> 
                  However, my life is not solely focused on coding and technology. I have a deep love for birds and birdwatching, which brings me tranquility and inspiration. Hence, I decided to incorporate a flying goose logo, symbolizing my constant pursuit of growth and improvement. On this website, I showcase my projects and work that I have been involved.
                <p>Thank you for visiting, and I hope you find the inspiration and interest that I aimed to convey on my website.</p>
